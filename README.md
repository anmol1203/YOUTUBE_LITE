The YouTube Clone is a web application built using React.js that allows users to search and watch videos. It closely mimics the functionality of YouTube, enabling users to enter search queries and receive relevant video results. 

The main features of the app include:-

Video Search: Users can enter keywords into the search bar to find videos based on their interests or queries.

Video Playback: When users click on a video from the search results or related videos section, it plays the video on the app's built-in video player.

Video Thumbnails: Each video is displayed with its thumbnail image for easy recognition.

Video Length Indicator: The app shows the length of each video with a timer, giving users an idea of the video's duration.

Loading Animations: During data fetching from the YouTube API, loading animations are shown to indicate that content is being fetched.

Global State Management: React's Context API is used for efficient state management, handling loading status, search results, selected categories, and mobile menu status.

React Router: The app uses React Router to handle different routes, enabling seamless navigation between the feed, search result, and video details pages.

Overall, the YouTube Clone provides a user-friendly and familiar interface, allowing users to discover and watch videos with ease, just like they do on the original YouTube platform.
